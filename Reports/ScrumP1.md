# Sprint Planning

The team decided to work in two-week sprints with Adam as the first Scrum Leader. The team constructed a class diagram and CRC Cards to outline or project. This sprint, the team created our Kanban board and prioritized registration and login for the next two-week sprint; indicated by them being at the top of the Kanban board. 

The team chose to meet thrice-weekly at 3pm Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays for 'daily' Scrum sessions.

# Sprint Review

The team reviewed the CRC cards and class diagrams it had constructed, but does not currently have a base code to review.

# Sprint Retrospective

Looking forward, the team will alter the way we hold 'daily' Scrum sessions since Friday meetings often didn't have every member present. Other than those Friday meetings, Scrums have been going generally well otherwise; the team expects time spent doing Scrums to shorten as we settle into a rhythm.

The team has been buliding chemistry and cohesion. We've learned how to communicate more effectively and hold calls with our distance members (and those on-campus but absent due to illness or work) to ensure they're staying up to date.

One other issue the team will seek to improve upon is documenting our work more thoroughly next Sprint, and keeping a more consistent approach in our day-to-day work.
