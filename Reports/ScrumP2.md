# Relevant Information

Because our current sprint schedule doesnâ€™t line up perfectly with the due dates for P1, P2, and P3, here is a summary of our scrum ceremonies this sprint. Additionally, our scrum leader for almost all of October, Grant DeYoung, decided to withdraw from the course which caught our team off guard and threw a wrench in what we had hoped to accomplish.

# Sprint Planning

The team decided to take some additional time in the planning and design phase at the start of October. This led to starting the actual coding a little later, but gave us the ability to better grasp what needed to be accomplished and the best way to go about it. Initially, we chose three main user stories we were hoping to accomplish: User Registration, User Login, and Validating User Input

# Sprint Review

Reviewing the work done this month, we made progress on all of the user stories we had hoped and even brought in an additional user story: creating the board UI. This progress is in spite of the fact that we now only have four team members. We also added tests for some of the code we developed helping ensure the functionality of our game system. Lastly, we were able to successfully setup and use a SQL database to store user information in.

# Sprint Retrospective

Looking back at the sprint(s), our team recognizes the hard work that was put into this project and how important our initial planning and class diagrams were to the success of our project. We also did a good job of working around everyone's busy scheduling and the team was understanding when individual members had tests or assignments in other classes and couldn't devote quite as much time to our project.

A couple areas of improvement would be that our team wants to ensure that all of our members are contributing equally moving forward, and also that everyone has a good grasp of how the various parts of our project work together. We also wish that we could've accomplished even more this sprint, so that we could've had the ability to add more optional features.
