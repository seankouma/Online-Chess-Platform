# Sprint Planning

Scrum Master: Sean Kouma (although many responsibilities were shared equally among the team)

For P3 we decided to just use a single sprint to do all of our work in. We also planned on completing all of our remaining user stories for the project. This included: Send Invites, Game Board, Display Pieces, Respond to an invitation, Show Match History, and Save Game Progress. This was very ambitious considering we only have 4 team members.

# Sprint Review

Reviewing the work done this month, we completed all of the user stories we had hoped to. We weren't able to add as many tests as we wanted or have everything designed the way we had originall hoped, but we prioritized functionality above everything else. Through the completion of our stories, it's now possible to play Omega chess on the system. We also were able to efficiently use our database for user management and the team as a whole is now much more competent on a variety of technologies and tools.

# Sprint Retrospective

Looking back at the sprint, our team recognizes the immense amount of work that was put into this project and how important our initial planning was. We did a good job of working around everyone's schedules and we were very understanding of one another as a whole. We used the strengths of individual team members to make a working project and we're all quite proud of our project.

There are a couple areas where we believe we could use a lot of improvement. First of all, an issue we had in P2 that we had hoped to impove this sprint was that all team members would share the work equally. This issue actually ended up getting worse instead of better, largely due to how much more work we had to do this sprint. Secondly, we should've gotten a significantly larger amount of work done in our previous sprints instead of pushing it all off until this sprint. Our team really scrambled to get everything together and while we're happy we got it working, we wish we could've done it without rushing through it.
